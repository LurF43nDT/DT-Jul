I spy with my little eye…
A place full of stories, gifts, and games,
Triangles repeat, but not all mean the same.
Colors peek out where they don’t belong,
Some hide in plain sight, some feel wrong.

Count not the books,
Ignore the lights,
Stockings and shapes will waste your sight.
Look instead for guests who shouldn’t be here at all—
Rounded, bright, and silent, watching from shelves and sprawl.

When the right kind of figures are finally seen,
Not decorations, toys, or things in between,
Their total reveals what you need to say:
The answer is a letter… and a number’s way.
